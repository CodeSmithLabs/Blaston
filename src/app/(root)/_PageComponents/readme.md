PageComponents are building blocks of pages. While components are building blocks of PageComponents

Unlike components, PageComponents are specific to each page and a way to break up a page into seperate sections both for technical and organization reasons.

The directory has a underscore \_ before the name to exclude it from app routers routing.

The flow for building is components -> Page Components -> Pages
